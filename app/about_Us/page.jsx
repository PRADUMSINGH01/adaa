        Our Story: Inspired by Every Indian Woman
      </h2>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        This journey began in a small home in India, where our founder—a
        passionate woman named Meera—stitched Kurtis for her friends and
        neighbors using a second-hand sewing machine. With every thread, she
        stitched not just fabric, but the confidence and culture of every Indian
        woman.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        What started as a simple passion quickly grew into a movement. Meera
        believed that every woman, regardless of where she lives, deserves to
        feel beautiful in her own skin—wearing clothing that celebrates her
        roots and makes her feel proud. She began selling hand-designed Kurtis
        in her local market and within a year, word spread across the town.
      </p>

      <p className="mb-4 text-base leading-relaxed text-gray-800">
        Today, our brand stands for every dream that started small. We are here
        to represent the strength, elegance, and vibrance of Indian women. Every
        Kurti we design is not just a piece of fabric—it's a tribute to every
        woman who dares to dream and grow, just like Meera.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg font-semibold text-center mt-8 italic text-gray-600">
        "Behind every thread is a story. Behind every Kurti is courage."
